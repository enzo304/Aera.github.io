        <h2>I Have Something To Tell You</h2><br>
        <h2>My Love Aera </h2>
        <p>You don't understand how much
            you actually mean to me and I care
            about you a lot more than myself! I would do anything for you! I just want to make you smile! You are amazing, beautiful, funny, great personality, and have the worlds most beautiful smile When I see you or even get a simple text for you my whole day brightens up its so amazing how you can say hey and put a smile on my face I love when you laugh and I just love being with you! I'm so happy with you.you've brought so much happiness into my life and I can't possibly thank u enough. i can't wait to be able to live with you and show you how much i appreciate you and how important you are to me and that no matter what happens you've made an everlasting impression on me and im beyond thankful to have met you. there is alot of things to thank u for that i don't even know where to begin but i do wanna thank you for being there for me, treating me right, being the person i can tell anything to, being my weird best friend and most of all my beautiful caring wife. When I'm with you I'm happy, when we talk  its like I don't ever want to let go, when you make me smile it brings the sunshine out in me,, its like something i've never felt before. i know i'm not perfect. i know i have flaws. I know that i can be annoying & i know i can be quiet. i know i can be mean. i know i can be nice. i might not always mean that i say, but i care i know i can be a stupid sometimes.i can make u happy. make u smile. make you laugh. make u feel wanted. if i had a penny for every time i thought about you,, i would only have one,, because you never leave my mind.
            your my first thought when i wake up and my last though when i go to bed. you have made me smile and laugh so many times this past weeks. you have always been there for me. thank you for being you. you are so amazing and i am so lucky to call you babe. i love you so much. im glad you and i are together forever and always. i love you babe!! You're mine, I'm yours, its as simple as it is, it doesn't matter about whos good, whos bad, who can get better, what matters is You and I are Bestest Together I choose you. It's not really a difficult decision for me. As soon as I saw you, my destiny was tied with yours. Some people don't or won't understand, some even won't like it. But i choose you because my heart chose yours long before our bodies were born. I truly feel that we've loved one another lifetimes ago.So my love, I'm comforted by the fact that my love for you is eternal, and that I will see you next lifetime. I want you, and everything that comes with you. I want all your amazing aspects and all you terrifying sides. If there was a word to describe the feelings I have for you it would be incredible because it is incredible how much I love you, how much I care about you, how I look at you, how I talk about you,
            and it is really just incredible how much I want you.</p>
